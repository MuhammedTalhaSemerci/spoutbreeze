# SpoutBreeze

SpoutBreeze is an open source webinar platform designed based on BigBlueButton that makes reaching a larger audience
possible.

## Getting started

The main goal of the first versio we want to release is to be able to stream a BigBlueButton meeting to some selected media servers. The requirements will expand later.

## Community

All the project community is gathered in Github Discussions https://github.com/spoutbreeze/spoutbreeze/discussions
